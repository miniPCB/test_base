  "test_name": "STTO: Visual Inspection",
  "test_no": "001",
  "last_test_no": "",
  "purpose": "To verify the physical integrity and compliance of the circuit components and assembly with design specifications and quality standards.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test includes a thorough examination of all visible components, solder joints, and assembly practices to ensure adherence to specified design and quality standards. This encompasses checking for physical defects, proper orientation, and secure connections, as well as confirming that all components are correctly placed and meet the required specifications.",
  "setup": "Ensure the test area is clean and well-lit. Gather necessary tools for inspection, including magnifying glass, calipers, and a static-free work surface. Prepare the circuit board by removing it from any packaging and placing it on the work surface. Ensure all safety precautions are in place to prevent electrostatic discharge.",
  "procedure": "1. Inspect the circuit board visually under adequate lighting using a magnifying glass to identify any physical defects such as scratches, cracks, or missing components.  \n2. Verify the orientation and placement of all components against the design specifications, ensuring that polarities and markings are correct.  \n3. Examine solder joints for quality, checking for cold solder joints, bridging, and proper fillet formation.  \n4. Confirm that all connections are secure and that there are no loose components.  \n5. Document any discrepancies or defects found during the inspection for further analysis.  \n6. Ensure that the inspection is conducted in a static-free environment to prevent damage to sensitive components.",
  "measurement": "Visual inspection results, including the number and type of defects identified, component placement accuracy percentage, and solder joint quality ratings.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "All visible components must be free from physical defects, properly oriented, and securely connected. Component placement accuracy must be 100%, with no more than 2% of solder joints exhibiting quality issues. Any identified defects must be documented and addressed before proceeding to the next testing phase.",
  "conclusion": "The visual inspection of the circuit has confirmed that all components are free from physical defects, properly oriented, and securely connected. Component placement accuracy was verified at 100%, with solder joint quality meeting the acceptance criteria. No significant issues were identified, allowing progression to the next testing phase.",
