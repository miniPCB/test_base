  "test_name": "STTO: Polarities",
  "test_no": "002",
  "last_test_no": "001",
  "purpose": "To verify the correct polarity of the circuit connections and ensure proper functionality under specified operating conditions.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test encompasses the verification of polarity for all active and passive components within the circuit, including diodes, transistors, capacitors, inductors, integrated circuits, LEDs, and connectors, to ensure correct electrical connections and functionality.",
  "setup": "Ensure the circuit is powered off before setup. Connect the circuit to a power supply with adjustable voltage. Use a multimeter to verify the polarity of each connection point. Arrange the test environment to minimize interference, ensuring all components are accessible for measurement.",
  "procedure": "1. Power on the circuit and set the power supply to the specified operating voltage.\n2. Using a multimeter, measure the voltage at each connection point, ensuring the positive and negative terminals are correctly identified.\n3. Record the measured voltages and compare them against the expected values for each component.\n4. For diodes and LEDs, check the forward voltage drop to confirm correct polarity.\n5. Repeat measurements for all active and passive components, documenting any discrepancies.\n6. Power off the circuit after completing the measurements and ensure all connections are secure.",
  "measurement": "Voltage measurements at each connection point, including forward voltage drop for diodes and LEDs, to verify correct polarity and functionality.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "All measured voltages at connection points must match the expected values within a tolerance of ±5%. Diodes and LEDs must exhibit a forward voltage drop consistent with their specifications. Any discrepancies must be documented, and corrective actions taken if more than 10% of components fail to meet criteria.",
  "conclusion": "All measured voltages at the connection points were within the specified tolerance of ±5%, confirming correct polarity for all components tested. Diodes and LEDs exhibited forward voltage drops consistent with their specifications. No significant discrepancies were noted, indicating that the circuit connections are functioning as intended.",
