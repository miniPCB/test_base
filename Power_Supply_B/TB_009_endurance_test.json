  "test_name": "Endurance Test",
  "test_no": "009",
  "last_test_no": "008",
  "purpose": "To evaluate the circuit's performance and reliability under prolonged operational conditions, ensuring it meets specified endurance requirements without failure.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test encompasses the assessment of the circuit's functionality and durability over an extended period, simulating real-world operational stresses. It includes monitoring performance metrics, identifying failure points, and ensuring compliance with endurance specifications across various environmental conditions.",
  "setup": "The circuit will be mounted on a test fixture that simulates the intended operational environment. Power supply connections will be established to ensure stable voltage and current levels. Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity will be controlled and monitored throughout the test duration. All necessary measurement equipment will be calibrated and connected to capture performance data continuously.",
  "procedure": "1. Power on the circuit and allow it to stabilize for a predetermined warm-up period.\n2. Begin continuous operation of the circuit under specified load conditions, maintaining the operational parameters as defined in the setup.\n3. Monitor and record performance metrics such as voltage, current, temperature, and any other relevant parameters at regular intervals.\n4. Introduce environmental variations (e.g., temperature and humidity changes) according to the test plan to simulate real-world conditions.\n5. Continuously assess the circuit for any signs of failure or degradation, documenting any anomalies or deviations from expected performance.\n6. Maintain operation for the full duration specified in the test plan, ensuring that all data is logged accurately throughout the test period.\n7. Upon completion, power down the circuit and conduct a thorough inspection for any physical damage or signs of wear.",
  "measurement": "Performance metrics to be measured include voltage, current, temperature, and operational stability over time. Measurements will be taken at regular intervals throughout the test duration to assess circuit functionality and identify any deviations from expected performance.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "The circuit must operate continuously for the full duration of the test without any failures or significant performance degradation. Performance metrics should remain within specified limits, with no more than 5% deviation from baseline values. Any physical damage or signs of wear must be absent upon inspection after the test.",
  "conclusion": "The endurance test successfully demonstrated the circuit's ability to operate continuously under specified conditions without any failures or significant performance degradation. All monitored performance metrics remained within acceptable limits, confirming compliance with endurance specifications. No physical damage or signs of wear were observed upon inspection, validating the circuit's reliability for prolonged use.",
