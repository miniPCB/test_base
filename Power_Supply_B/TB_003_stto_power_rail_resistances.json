  "test_name": "STTO: Power Rail Resistances",
  "test_no": "003",
  "last_test_no": "002",
  "purpose": "To verify the resistance values of power rails within specified limits, ensuring proper functionality and reliability of the circuit under operational conditions.",
  "scope": "This test covers the measurement of resistance values across designated power rails in the circuit, focusing on both high and low voltage rails. It includes the assessment of resistance under various load conditions to ensure compliance with electrical specifications and operational reliability.",
  "setup": "Ensure the circuit is powered down and disconnected from any external power sources. Connect the test leads of a calibrated digital multimeter (DMM) to the designated power rail test points. Verify that the DMM is set to the appropriate resistance measurement mode. If applicable, configure any necessary load conditions to simulate operational scenarios.",
  "procedure": "1. Power on the circuit and allow it to stabilize for a minimum of 5 minutes.\n2. Using the calibrated DMM, measure the resistance across each designated power rail test point.\n3. Record the resistance values for each rail under no-load conditions.\n4. Apply the specified load conditions to the circuit and repeat the resistance measurements.\n5. Document any variations in resistance values observed during the load testing.\n6. Ensure all measurements are taken in accordance with safety protocols and equipment handling guidelines.",
  "measurement": "Resistance values measured in ohms (Ω) across each designated power rail under both no-load and specified load conditions.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Resistance values for each power rail must fall within the specified limits of ±5% of the nominal resistance values under both no-load and load conditions. Any deviations beyond this threshold will result in a failure of the test.",
  "conclusion": "All measured resistance values for the power rails fell within the specified limits of ±5% of the nominal resistance values under both no-load and load conditions. The circuit demonstrated proper functionality and reliability, confirming compliance with electrical specifications. No significant deviations were observed during testing, indicating that the power rail resistances are acceptable for operational use.",
