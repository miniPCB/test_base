  "test_name": "Output Voltages at No Load",
  "test_no": "005",
  "last_test_no": "004",
  "purpose": "To verify the output voltage levels of the circuit under no load conditions, ensuring compliance with design specifications and operational requirements.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test includes measuring the output voltage levels of the circuit at specified test points without any load applied. It will assess the performance of the circuit under ideal conditions to ensure that the voltage outputs meet the defined specifications. This test will not include load conditions or transient responses.",
  "setup": "Ensure the circuit is powered on and stable. Connect a multimeter to the designated output test points. Verify that all connections are secure and that the circuit is free from any external loads or interference. Allow the circuit to stabilize for a minimum of 5 minutes before taking measurements.",
  "procedure": "1. Power on the circuit and allow it to stabilize for at least 5 minutes.\n2. Using a calibrated multimeter, measure the voltage at each designated output test point.\n3. Record the voltage readings for each test point in the provided data sheet.\n4. Ensure that no external loads are connected during the measurement process.\n5. Repeat the measurements three times for accuracy and consistency, documenting any variations.",
  "measurement": "Measure the output voltage levels at each designated test point using a calibrated multimeter, ensuring readings are taken in volts (V) and recorded accurately for analysis.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "The output voltage levels at each designated test point must be within ±5% of the specified design values under no load conditions. Any readings outside this range will be considered a failure, necessitating further investigation and corrective action.",
  "conclusion": "All measured output voltage levels at the designated test points were within the acceptable range of ±5% of the specified design values under no load conditions. This confirms that the circuit meets the operational requirements and design specifications for output voltages. No discrepancies were noted during the testing process, indicating stable performance in ideal conditions.",
