  "test_name": "Output Voltages Under Load",
  "test_no": "006",
  "last_test_no": "005",
  "purpose": "To verify that the circuit outputs the specified voltage levels under defined load conditions, ensuring proper functionality and performance in operational scenarios.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test includes evaluating the output voltage levels of the circuit when subjected to specified load conditions. It encompasses the assessment of voltage stability, accuracy, and compliance with design specifications across various operational scenarios. The test will focus on identifying any deviations from expected performance metrics under load, ensuring the circuit meets reliability and functionality standards.",
  "setup": "Connect the circuit to a stable power supply set to the specified input voltage. Attach the appropriate load resistors to the output terminals to simulate operational conditions. Ensure all connections are secure and verify that the circuit is properly grounded. Use a calibrated multimeter to measure output voltages at designated test points.",
  "procedure": "1. Power on the circuit and allow it to stabilize for a minimum of 5 minutes.\n2. Using the calibrated multimeter, measure the output voltage at each designated test point while the load is applied.\n3. Record the voltage readings for each test point under the specified load conditions.\n4. Repeat the measurements three times to ensure consistency and reliability of the results.\n5. Document any fluctuations or deviations from the expected voltage levels during the testing process.",
  "measurement": "Measure the output voltage at each designated test point using a calibrated multimeter, ensuring readings are taken under specified load conditions. Record the voltage values to assess stability and compliance with design specifications.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "The output voltage at each designated test point must remain within ±5% of the specified voltage levels under load conditions. Any significant deviations or fluctuations exceeding this threshold will result in a failure of the test.",
  "conclusion": "The test results indicate that the circuit successfully maintained output voltage levels within the specified ±5% tolerance under load conditions. All measured values were consistent across multiple trials, demonstrating the circuit's reliability and adherence to design specifications. No significant deviations or fluctuations were observed, confirming the circuit's performance meets operational requirements.",
