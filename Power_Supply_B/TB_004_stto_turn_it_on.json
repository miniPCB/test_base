  "test_name": "STTO: Turn It On",
  "test_no": "004",
  "last_test_no": "003",
  "purpose": "To verify the functionality and stability of the circuit upon initial power-up, ensuring all components operate within specified parameters.",
  "scope": "The scope of this test includes the assessment of the circuit's power-up sequence, verification of voltage levels across critical components, and monitoring for any abnormal behaviors or failures during the initial activation phase. It encompasses all relevant circuit elements and connections to ensure comprehensive evaluation of operational readiness.",
  "setup": "Ensure the circuit is securely mounted on a stable test bench. Connect the power supply to the designated input terminals, verifying correct polarity. Set the power supply to the specified voltage level required for operation. Ensure all measurement equipment is calibrated and connected to the appropriate test points for voltage monitoring. Confirm that all necessary safety precautions are in place before proceeding with the power-up sequence.",
  "procedure": "1. Ensure all setup connections are secure and correct.\n2. Gradually apply power to the circuit while monitoring the current draw.\n3. Observe the power-up sequence, noting any delays or irregularities.\n4. Measure and record voltage levels at critical points as the circuit powers up.\n5. Monitor for any abnormal sounds, smells, or visual indicators of failure.\n6. Allow the circuit to stabilize for a predetermined duration before further assessment.\n7. Document all observations and measurements for analysis.",
  "measurement": "Measure and record the voltage levels at the input and output terminals, as well as across critical components such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits during the power-up sequence. Additionally, monitor the current draw to ensure it remains within specified limits throughout the activation phase.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "All components must power up without failure, with voltage levels at critical points within ±5% of specified values. Current draw should not exceed maximum limits. No abnormal sounds, smells, or visual indicators of malfunction should be present during the power-up sequence.",
  "conclusion": "The circuit successfully powered up, with all components operating within the specified voltage range and current limits. No abnormal behaviors or indicators of failure were observed during the power-up sequence, confirming the circuit's operational readiness. All acceptance criteria were met, indicating a stable and functional design.",
