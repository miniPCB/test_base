  "test_name": "Gate Drive Performance Verification",
  "test_no": "010",
  "last_test_no": "006",
  "purpose": "Validate the performance of the gate drive waveform to ensure it meets specified requirements for amplitude, timing, and slew rate under operational load conditions.\n",
  "scope": "Scope includes all devices under test (DUTs) utilizing the specified gate driver circuit, focusing on performance metrics such as waveform integrity, amplitude, timing, and slew rate across varying operational conditions.",
  "setup": "Connect DUT under normal load. Probe gate at the FET gate pad with appropriate probe and bandwidth.",
  "procedure": "1. Operate DUT at nominal input voltage and load.\n2. Capture gate drive waveforms during switching.\n3. Repeat at minimum and maximum input voltages.",
  "measurement": "Measure gate rise/fall times, peak gate voltage, and any ringing.",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Gate voltage must remain within specified limits with acceptable rise/fall times and limited ringing.",
  "conclusion": "The gate drive integrity test successfully verified that the gate drive waveform met the required amplitude, timing, and slew rate specifications under load conditions. All measured parameters fell within the acceptance criteria, indicating reliable performance of the gate driver circuit across the tested input voltage range.",
